<h1>Text visualization is an increasingly used method for analyzing different concepts and phenomena in texts. Encouraged by open data initiatives, crowdfunding and collaboration, academics and amateurs have created numerous ways of text visualization techniques.  In the first part of this small project draft attention is given to one example of single-text visualization: character co-occurrence in the Lord of the Rings Project (LotrProject). What techniques are used and how is textual information transmitted to the viewer? The second part discusses how these techniques can be used when focusing on detective literature, in particular Edgar Allen Poe's The Murder in the Rue Morgue (1841), The Mystery of Marie Roget (1842), The Purloined Letter (1844), Wilkie Collinsâ€™s The Moonstone (1868), Arthur Conan Doyle's A Study in Scarlet (1887) and Agatha Christie's The Mysterious Affair at Styles (1920).
