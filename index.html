<h3>Text visualization is an increasingly used method for analyzing different concepts and phenomena in texts. Encouraged by open data initiatives, crowdfunding and collaboration, academics and amateurs have created numerous ways of text visualization techniques.  In the first part of this small project draft attention is given to one example of single-text visualization: character co-occurrence in the Lord of the Rings Project (LotrProject). What techniques are used and how is textual information transmitted to the viewer? The second part discusses how these techniques can be used when focusing on detective literature, in particular Edgar Allen Poe's The Murder in the Rue Morgue (1841), The Mystery of Marie Roget (1842), The Purloined Letter (1844), Wilkie Collins’s The Moonstone (1868), Arthur Conan Doyle's A Study in Scarlet (1887) and Agatha Christie's The Mysterious Affair at Styles (1920).

<h2> Which project did inspire this draft? In 2012 the LotrProject was created by chemical engineer Emil Johannson. His fascination for Tolkien’s mythical works inspired him to create multiple datasets and visualizations. Non-profit and crowdfunded, Johannson proves that amateur fans can create and use interesting techniques.  A specific part of the project is dedicated to character co-occurrence: the amount of times characters are mentioned on the same page. Figures 2 and 3 show examples of the Hobbit and the Lotr. The size of the nodes indicates the total amount of mentions of one character. In the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins is obviously the protagonist. The thickness of the edges indicates the amount of times two characters are mentioned on the same page. Using this crude method, relations and parallels can be discovered between (clusters) of characters. There are some drawbacks however. First, selection by page (and not by chapter) is very arbitrary. Second, characters may be mentioned on the same page, but this does not mean that they interact. Third, we do not know in what setting characters are mentioned: do characters speak about each other or do they speak themselves?
